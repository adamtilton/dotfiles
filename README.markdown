THE DOTFILES CREED
=

    This is my dotfiles.   There are many like it, but this one is mine.  My
    dotfiles is my best friend.  It is my life.  I must master it as I
    master my life.  My dotfiles, without me, is useless.  Without my
    dotfiles, I am useless.  I must edit my dotfiles true.  I must hack
    straighter than my computer who is trying to confound me.  I must hack
    it before it confounds me.  I will .  .  .

    My dotfiles and myself know that what counts in this war is not the
    LoC we edit, the noise of our keys, nor the smoke we make.  We know
    that it is the hits that count.  We will hit .  .  .

    My dotfiles is human, even as I, because it is my life.  Thus, I will
    learn it as a brother.  I will learn its weakness, its strength, its
    parts, its accessories, its lines and its columns.  I will keep my
    dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.  We will become
    part of each other.  We will .  .  .

    Before (Git|SVN|etc) I swear this creed.  My dotfiles and myself are the
    defenders of my country.  We are the masters of our enemy.  We are the
    saviors of my life.  So be it, until victory is teh Interweb's and there
    is no enemy, but Peace.
